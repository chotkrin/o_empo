## Overview

EMPO (Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization) does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries, EMPO enables self-supervised RL for reasoning capabilities.

## News

- [2025-04-08] We introduce EMPO, which makes the first attempt on fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. Check out our arxiv preprint (first released at 2025.04.08): https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05812
- [2025-04-30] We release the training and evaluation code for both mathematical reasoning and free-form natural reasoning tasks.
- [2025-06-10] EMPO was accepted by ICML 2025 Test-time Adaption Workshop. See you in Vancouver!

## TRL Quick Start

> Developed upon trl 0.14.0

```
cd trl
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh empo-1.5B-NM-COT-20K.sh
```

## Verl Quick Start
> Developed upon TTRL, with necessary modification to upgrade to the latest verl==0.4.0

```
cd verl
sh examples/ttrl/empo-math.sh
```


## Evaluation:
> The evaluation scripts from the [Online-DPO-R1](https://github.com/RLHFlow/Online-DPO-R1), please refer to the original codebase for more details.

For mathematical tasks:
```
cd eval_math
sh test.sh
```

As suggested by [Spurious Rewards](https://rethink-rlvr.notion.site/Spurious-Rewards-Rethinking-Training-Signals-in-RLVR-1f4df34dac1880948858f95aeb88872f) and [Incorrect Baseline](https://safe-lip-9a8.notion.site/Incorrect-Baseline-Evaluations-Call-into-Question-Recent-LLM-RL-Claims-2012f1fbf0ee8094ab8ded1953c15a37#2022f1fbf0ee80cb9b18f7eac460410a), we adpot the same test prompt to both pre-RL Qwen Base models and RL-trained models. Besdies, we add Random+Format Reward Baseline for more comprehensive comparison. You can also modify the code [here](https://github.com/QingyangZhang/EMPO/blob/main/eval_math/utils.py#L140) to investigate the influence of different test prompt.
